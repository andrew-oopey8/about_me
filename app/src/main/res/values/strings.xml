    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Andrew,
        \n I love coding I\'m a flutter developer, and I live in the Seattle area. \nI\'m going to describe what I do, and how to get started with it.
\n I first learned about Flutter as an approach to Android app development. That is to say, I learned about it when I learned about the Android platform as an approach to app development.
        \n I didnot care much about what Google\'s preferred app development approach was. What I wanted to know was, how do I make Android apps? The answer is: Flutter.
Flutter is a rendering library for your Android app. It was designed to minimize friction for users, and focus more on doing the right thing in the right way.
My first impression of Flutter was that it did this better than any other developer environment I had used previously.
